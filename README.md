# Tensor_Dnn
use tensorflow to build a three-layer NN
this is an example for using tensoflow to build a three-layer NN,actualy,there are just three layers,and the first layer just has one node,and the second layer has ten nodes,and the output layer has one layer too,so it is a simple example to show how to build a NN using tensorflow,afterwards,i will train deeper layers to fit complex function.
